This is a port of the StellarisWare 10636 enet_ptpd LM3S9B96 example, to an EK-TM4C1294XL using TivaWare 2.1.0.12573

This project contains the following version of source files from TivaWare:
third_party/lwip-1.4.1/src/core/ipv4/ip.c
   Modified the ip_input() function to cause PTPD messages to be passed to the the UDP protocol without having
   a multicast interface configured. The code was copied from the StellarisWare version of the ip_input() function.
   Consider modifying the PTPD code to join the PTP multicast group to avoid this modification.
   
third_party/lwip-1.4.1/ports/tiva-tm4c129/netif/tiva-tm4c129.c
   The tivaif_receive() function has been changed to call lwIPHostGetTime() to obtain the receive timestamp, rather
   than using the timestamp placed in the receive descriptor by the hardware.
   This is a temporary modification due to the code in enet_ptpd.c maintaining it's own clock rather than using the
   EMAC system time.
